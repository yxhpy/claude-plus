## Keyboard shortcuts

<Note>
  Keyboard shortcuts may vary by platform and terminal. Press `?` to see available shortcuts for your environment.

  **macOS users**: Option/Alt key shortcuts (`Alt+B`, `Alt+F`, `Alt+Y`, `Alt+M`, `Alt+P`) require configuring Option as Meta in your terminal:

  * **iTerm2**: Settings → Profiles → Keys → Set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"
  * **Terminal.app**: Settings → Profiles → Keyboard → Check "Use Option as Meta Key"
  * **VS Code**: Settings → Profiles → Keys → Set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

  See [Terminal configuration](/en/terminal-config) for details.

### MCP prompts

MCP servers can expose prompts that appear as commands. These use the format `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` and are dynamically discovered from connected servers. See [MCP prompts](/en/mcp#use-mcp-prompts-as-commands) for details.

## Vim editor mode

Enable vim-style editing with `/vim` command or configure permanently via `/config`.

| `yw`/`ye`/`yb` | Yank word/to end/back   |
| `p`            | Paste after cursor      |
| `P`            | Paste before cursor     |
| `>>`           | Indent line             |
| `<<`           | Dedent line             |
| `J`            | Join lines              |
| `.`            | Repeat last change      |

### Text objects (NORMAL mode)

Text objects work with operators like `d`, `c`, and `y`:

| Command   | Action                                   |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `iw`/`aw` | Inner/around word                        |
| `iW`/`aW` | Inner/around WORD (whitespace-delimited) |
| `i"`/`a"` | Inner/around double quotes               |
| `i'`/`a'` | Inner/around single quotes               |
| `i(`/`a(` | Inner/around parentheses                 |
| `i[`/`a[` | Inner/around brackets                    |
| `i{`/`a{` | Inner/around braces                      |

## Command history

Claude Code maintains command history for the current session:

* History is stored per working directory
* Cleared with `/clear` command
* Use Up/Down arrows to navigate (see keyboard shortcuts above)
* **Note**: History expansion (`!`) is disabled by default

### Reverse search with Ctrl+R

Press `Ctrl+R` to interactively search through your command history:

1. **Start search**: Press `Ctrl+R` to activate reverse history search
2. **Type query**: Enter text to search for in previous commands - the search term will be highlighted in matching results
3. **Navigate matches**: Press `Ctrl+R` again to cycle through older matches
4. **Accept match**:
   * Press `Tab` or `Esc` to accept the current match and continue editing
   * Press `Enter` to accept and execute the command immediately
5. **Cancel search**:
   * Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and restore your original input
   * Press `Backspace` on empty search to cancel

The search displays matching commands with the search term highlighted, making it easy to find and reuse previous inputs.

## Background bash commands

Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.

### How backgrounding works

When Claude Code runs a command in the background, it runs the command asynchronously and immediately returns a background task ID. Claude Code can respond to new prompts while the command continues executing in the background.

To run commands in the background, you can either:

* Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
* Press Ctrl+B to move a regular Bash tool invocation to the background. (Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice due to tmux's prefix key.)

**Key features:**

* Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the TaskOutput tool
* Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
* Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

To disable all background task functionality, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS` environment variable to `1`. See [Environment variables](/en/settings#environment-variables) for details.

**Common backgrounded commands:**

* Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
* Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
* Test runners (jest, pytest)
* Development servers
* Long-running processes (docker, terraform)

### Bash mode with `!` prefix

Run bash commands directly without going through Claude by prefixing your input with `!`:

```bash  theme={null}
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la
```

Bash mode:

* Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
* Shows real-time progress and output
* Supports the same `Ctrl+B` backgrounding for long-running commands
* Does not require Claude to interpret or approve the command
* Supports history-based autocomplete: type a partial command and press **Tab** to complete from previous `!` commands in the current project

This is useful for quick shell operations while maintaining conversation context.

## Task list

When working on complex, multi-step work, Claude creates a task list to track progress. Tasks appear in the status area of your terminal with indicators showing what's pending, in progress, or complete.

* Press `Ctrl+T` to toggle the task list view. The display shows up to 10 tasks at a time
* To see all tasks or clear them, ask Claude directly: "show me all tasks" or "clear all tasks"
* Tasks persist across context compactions, helping Claude stay organized on larger projects
* To share a task list across sessions, set `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` to use a named directory in `~/.claude/tasks/`: `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=my-project claude`
* To revert to the previous TODO list, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TASKS=false`.
